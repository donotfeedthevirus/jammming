# Objective

The goal is to make an application for users to find albums to hear, track their progress, score them, compare to friends and to get recommendations based on their favorites or a selection of albums.
The user would be able to log in and search and add albums to their library and to be able to listen and rate them. The users can also add other users as friends and recommend albums.
